        A computer is an electronic device that was discovered by Charles Babbage. He is known as the father of computers. There are various parts to a computer. The four major parts of a computer are the mouse, keyboard, monitor and CPU. With computers, we can send and receive messages through emails and save important information. It helps to store and modify data. Nowadays, computers are used in schools, banks, offices, etc., and it is now impossible to survive without computers. In order to run any organisation, institution, or any other office, a computer is a must. Computers have made life easier for people of different age groups.
